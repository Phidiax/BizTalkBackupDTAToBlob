# BizTalkBackupDTADBToBlob


## Project Back Story

This project began when Sandro Pereira asked me (Tom Canter) to explore how BizTalk Server backups could be extended to support Azure Blob Storage. Leveraging my historical BizTalk backup scripts and community knowledge, the process was updated and enhanced to support secure, credential-based Blob backups. The result is a modernized solution for BizTalk Server environments, built on years of experience and collaboration.

This work is dedicated to the BizTalk community and all contributors who have helped advance BizTalk Server best practices.

---

## Project Overview

This project provides enhanced BizTalk Server backup scripts and job configuration to support backing up the BizTalk Tracking (DTA) database to Azure Blob Storage. **All other BizTalk databases already support backup to Azure Blob Storage using built-in features; this solution specifically adds support for the DTA database.**


## Features

- Updated stored procedures for Azure Blob Storage support (DTA database only)
- SQL Credential integration for secure backups
- Step-by-step installation and configuration guides



## Getting Started

1. Follow the instructions in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) to install and configure the scripts.

> **Note:** This solution is designed for manual installation and configuration. Automation of deployment or installation is out of scope and not supported. All steps should be performed by a qualified administrator following the provided documentation.


## Documentation

- [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md): Installation and update instructions
- [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md): Project credits


## Production Readiness

This solution has been thoroughly reviewed, tested, and validated for production deployment in BizTalk Server environments. All scripts, configuration steps, and documentation are designed to meet enterprise standards for reliability and maintainability. The team can proceed with confidence to deploy and support this solution in production.
